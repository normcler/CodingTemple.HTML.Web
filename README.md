The running version of this website is available at https://codingtemple.github.io/CodingTempleWebsite/

## Project Overview
1. The goal of this is to show a step-by-step evolution of the a web site, corresponding to concepts discussed in Coding Temple's HTML overview sessions.

## Instructions 
1. Each branch of this project represents a "checkpoint" in the evolution of the application.  The master branch shows the initial state of the application and some visual assets.
2. Clone or fork this master branch, and gradually work through each of the steps outlined below until you arrive at the final project state.
3. There are several additional pages referenced in the document that do not exist, but are used to demonstrate relative links.
4. No additional software is needed to run this application, it is a stand-alone HTML application which can be run from the file system.
